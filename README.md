## TrybeWallet
Project developed at the end of block 16, in which I studied about _Redux and how to integrate it with React_.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. There is a first route for you to do your login into the program.
2. The user can add their expenses, including how much did they spent, the description, in which currency it was paid, if they paid in cash, debit, or credit, and what tag represents this expense (that could be: alimentation, work, transport, health, and leisure).
3. After the expense is added to the page table, the value is converted to reais, which is the Brazilian currency.
4. At the top of the page, it showed the total amount spent.
5. You can add, edit and delete the expenses.
6. The values used to make the conversion, come from an [API](https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/all).

> It's important to highlight that only the documents produced by me are in the repository. For some of the projects, Trybe, which is the course that I'm following, gives us some functions/objects/styling that helps us to conclude the project, so the repository may seem incomplete.
